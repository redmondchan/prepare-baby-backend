Hi <%= @user.name.capitalize%>,

Welcome to BabyGotchi! This will simulate a very small aspect of taking care of a baby.

How to keep the baby's HP(Happiness Points) above 0:
- Feed the baby about every 3 hours.
- Change the baby's diaper about every 2.5 hours.

Calculations of food and diaper cost are rough estimates after a quick research. Diapers are $0.30 each and a feeding is about $1.50 worth of formula.

This expereince is simulating one mother's expereince. Your own experience may vary.
